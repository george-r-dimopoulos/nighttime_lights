# Impact of Economic Sanctions on Russia using Nightlight Data
Analyzing the effect of economic sanctions on Russia using nighttime lights data.

Our research topic aims to explore the impact of international economic sanctions placed
on Russia by analyzing nightlight intensity. In particular, we wish to explore three major periods: the 2014 Crimea sanctions, the 2018 Skripal Poisoning sanctions, and the 2022 Invasion of Ukraine sanctions. In short, our goal is to answer the following research question: "How have international sanctions on Russia influenced their economic activity?".

Using VIIRS Nightlight data, our goal is to analyze and track brightness changes over time. Our approach is to compare nightligth data from before, during, and after these sanctions were placed, with a focus on key economic centres and industrial regions that were heavily affected by the sanctions. Using these images and the given nightlight intensities during times of sanction, our goal is to correlate these changes with known economic indicators such as GDP, trade volume, and other variables to assess the impact of sanctions at a granular level.

We found that, in all three cases, sanctions were correlated with an increase in radiance from Russia. Possible explanations include increased production to compensate for restricted imports, expansion of oil use due to newfound domestic surplus, or increased economic independence in the wake of retaliatory sanctions. 

Our analysis, including regression results, can be found in the PowerPoint slide deck presented in this repository.
